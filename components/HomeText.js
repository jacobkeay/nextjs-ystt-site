      <p>
        As a think-tank, we mainly produce policy papers on topics proposed by
        our members. We aim to give students an opportunity to experience
        policy-writing as a different way of engaging with politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through a variety of workshops hosted the first and second terms, we
        seek to provide students with the skills required to produce good policy
        ideas. This will include how to conduct both quantitative and
        qualitative research as well as how to present the finding of research
        in a professional format. We additionally host speakers from a vast
        array of fields - aiming to show how ideas and research-based planning
        can lead to real-life change.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        The world of politics and policy-making is one with high barriers to
        entry - it is difficult to know where to even start. We aim to be that
        starting point, giving students an opportunity to experience the field
        as well as to provide them with the tools necessary to start a career
        after University. Writing policy also allows one to contribute as well
        as engage with ideas to solve current problems.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        To provide an opportunity to understand and engage with debates that are
        shaping current issues. We believe in pragmatic but honest research,
        closely following the Universityâ€™s guidelines on research integrity. We
        believe that in a world increasingly shaped by partisan politics, to
        increase the accessibility of policy-making is to encourage an approach
        to politics that is primarily shaped by facts.
