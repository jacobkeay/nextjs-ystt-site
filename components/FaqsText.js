          <strong>Project Questions</strong>
        </h2>
        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>What is the typical duration of a research project?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          The typical duration of a research project is anywhere between 1 and 2
          months. They take place during the Christmas and Summer breaks to have
          as minimal an effect on your coursework as possible.
        </p>
        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>
            How much work can I expect when joining a research project?
          </strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          You can expect to have anywhere between 10-15 hours of work a week,
          though this might vary depending on the ambition of your project.
        </p>
        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>What are the roles available on projects?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          You can be one of two different roles on projects, either a researcher
          or the research group leader. The role of a researcher might differ
          significantly from project to project as the research group leader
          might assign tasks based on the individual abilities of the members of
          his project.

          <strong>Application Process</strong>
        </h2>
        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>Who can apply?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          Anyone can apply to join a research group, no matter the degree or
          year level.
        </p>

        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>How much experience do I need to join?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          No prior experience is necessary to join a research group. A good
          candidate is one that is willing to learn and dedicate time to the
          project.
        </p>

        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>How many people will be in the teams?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          Though this can vary from project to project, they have an average 6-8
          researchers at a time (including the research group leader).
        </p>

        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>How can I become a research group leader?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          There are two ways to become a research group leader. You can either
          propose your own topic and lead it, or apply to become a research
          group leader for one of the projects we do in collaboration with
          charities or other student think-tanks. You can find the applications
          to do both under projects.
        </p>

        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>Will I be receiving support?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          Research can sometimes be overwhelming. We will be alongside
          throughout the entire process to help you every step of the way. Don’t
          be afraid to reach out to us or your research group leader with any
          trouble you might have.
        </p>

        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>How does the application process work?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          The application process has two steps: first an online form, and
          second an interview. If your form is accepted by the research group
          leader, you will be invited to an interview. After the interview, you
          will be informed of whether you were accepted or not.
        </p>

          <strong>
            Will I be penalised for not being free for a compulsory meeting (if
            successful)?
          </strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          So long as the reason why you can’t attend is reasonable, you will not
          be penalised. Make sure you always warn your research group leader if
          you cannot be present for a compulsory meeting.

        </h2>

        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>How do I best prepare for the interview?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          You can best prepare for the interview by researching your topic in
          question, and thinking of the reasons that made you choose it.
        </p>

        <h5 className="pt-2">
          <strong>When will I find out the interview outcome?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p className="pl-3">
          We announce the outcomes of the interviews a day after all interviews
          for your research group have taken place. You can find the specific
          date on the application itself.

        <p className="pl-3">
          If you have a problem with your application or interview, don’t
          hesitate on reaching out to us via Facebook, or emailing us at

          We host workshops, speaker events, and socials that are open to all
          society members - you don’t have to be part of a research group. We
          also run the Socrates Cafe twice a week on Tuesdays and Saturdays - an
          opportunity to meet and discuss with other members of the society.
